SwiftUI JSON fetching and error handling with REDUX

This project uses the SwiftUI architecture REDUX. This is a clean and simple way to control the state of the application
This simplified navigating the Loading, Retrieved and Error states laid out in the project description
Here is a link to the REDUX framework [https://medium.com/neudesic-innovation/managing-swiftui-state-using-redux-525a8879c1be]

You the run the project by: Opening the XCode project and running it
The third party libraries I used was the HTTPLibrary that I built here [https://github.com/JoshRambert/HTTPLibrary] this is a private REPO.
Would love to go over the process of building it in the future.

This was my first time creating a project using REDUX and SwiftUI. Wanted to challenge myself with this project
I love learning new technologies and buidling apps so I probably spent more time on this than I should've haha. I will say about 7-8 hours. Mainly spent
working my away around the REDUX architecture.
